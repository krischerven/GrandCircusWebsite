	<h2>My Hobby</h2>
	<strong><big>Programming</big></strong> has always been my favorite hobby since before I was even a teenager.<br>
	I started out learning C++ to make simple games when I was 10 or 11, and now I've <br>
	achieved a  decent level of proficiency in a number of languages like Go, Python,<br>
	and Bash. Right now I'm studying Java at Grand Circus.<br>
